            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Howard Phillips Lovecraft (20 August 1890 - 15 March 1937) was an American author of fantasy, horror,
                and science fiction, noted for combining these three genres within single narratives and most famous for
                the creation of the Cthulhu Mythos. He is considered, along with Edgar Allan Poe, to be one of the
                greatest Horror writers.
            </p>
            <p>
                He wrote many horror short stories. These often were about odd creatures that Lovecraft made up by
                himself or with his friends, including August Derleth, who wrote mysteries. The creatures did not really
                care about human people at all.
                They looked at us like we would be ants. Their behaviour, attitude and look also tended to make people
                go crazy.
            </p>
            <p>
                His stories were inspiration for lots of other authors.The spirit of his works, presenting a
                world that does not care, is present in many works of fiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lovecraft was interested in science from childhood, but lifelong poor health prevented him from
                attending
                college. He made his living as a ghostwriter and rewrite man and spent most of his life in seclusion and
                poverty. His fame as a writer increased after his death. He died of small intestine cancer.

                    From 1923 on, most of Lovecraft's short stories appeared in the magazine Weird Tales. His Cthulhu
                    Mythos
                    series of tales describe ordinary New Englanders' encounters with horrific beings of
                    extraterrestrial
                    origin. In these short stories, Lovecraft's intimate knowledge of New England's geography and
                    culture is
                    blended with an elaborate original mythology. His other short stories deal with similarly terrifying
                    phenomena in which horror and morbid fantasy acquire an unexpected verisimilitude.

                <p>The Case of Charles
                    Dexter Ward (1927; published posthumously 1941), At the Mountains of Madness (1931, published 1936),
                    and
                    The Shadow over Innsmouth (1931, published 1936) are considered his best short novels. Lovecraft was
                    a
                    master of poetic language, and he attained unusually high literary standards in his particular
                    fictional
                    genre.
