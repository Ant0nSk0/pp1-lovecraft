### Home 
- The front page features a short introduction to Lovecraft next to a photograph of him from around 1930. Under the introduction is a famous quote of his that perfectly describes his literature and philosophies.

### Works
- On the Works page the user will first see the Works of Horror section, or if they have a larger viewport, both the works of horror section and the Cthulhu Mythos section will be visible side by side.  

- The Works of Horror section features a short description of his writings followed by a list of his horror fiction stories. At the bottom there's a link to Lovecraft's complete bibliography on Wikipedia, which opens in another tab.

## Testing
*All tests had a positive outcome unless stated otherwise*  
- Audioplayer and all the links, including the sign-up form, was tested in all the following browsers/devices and worked as intended.  

    - Tested in Chrome with responsive device mode.
    - Tested in Firefox.
    - Tested in Edge.
    - Tested on my phone (Samsung A224G) with Chrome and Samsung Internet.  
- Tested different sizes to make sure the website was responsive and all breakpoints worked as intended as well as being presented correctly. For instance, the 'Works' page lets users with wider screens be presented with both the 'Works of Horror' section and the 'Cthulhu Mythos' section positioned next to each other, while users with narrower screens and tablets get presented with the 'Works of Horror' section first, 'Cthulhu Mythos' second. Mobile users recieve a similar experience with a smoother layout without borders.

### Works

### Biography  
![Lighthouse Report Biography](assets/images/readme-images/deployed-lovecraft-biography.PNG)
Lighthouse was run in Chrome incognito mode as recommended by various sources such as [Intellitonic](https://intellitonic.com/blog/google-lighthouse/) and [Flexiple](https://flexiple.com/developers/using-google-lighthouse-to-audit-your-web-application/)  
I did find it a bit inconsistent between audits, especially between using incognito or not. 
## Validator Testing
- HTML - There is no errors going through [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) 
    - I had initially one error/warning because I had used a span instead of div. Simple solution to replace the span with the necessary div.
- CSS - There is no errors going through [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
