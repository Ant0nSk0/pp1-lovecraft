# Lovecraft
This project is about the life and works of H.P. Lovecraft. It contains useful information for both fans and people new to Lovecraft's works. 

## Features
In the top right corner we have our navigation section, with links to the three pages being Home, Works, and Biography.
### Home 
- The front page features a short introduction to Lovecraft next to a photograph of him from around 1930. Under the introduction is a famous quote of his that perfectly describes his literature and philosophies.

- Below we find some quotes about Lovecraft from different authors that he inspired.
- Also featured here is a form for the user to fill in if they want to sign up to the newsletter.

- At the bottom of the page is our footer with links to Goodreads, LibriVox and Wikipedia. There is also an arrow icon to take the user back to the top of the page.

### Works
- On the Works page the user will first see the Works of Horror section, or if they have a larger viewport, both the works of horror section and the Cthulhu Mythos section will be visible side by side.
- The Works of Horror section features a short description of his writings followed by a list of his horror fiction stories. At the bottom there's a link to Lovecraft's complete bibliography on Wikipedia, which opens in another tab.
- The Cthulhu Mythos section features a picture of Cthulhu and a description of what the mythos is. 
- Below these two sections is an audioplayer with an audiobook of The Nameless City - provided by LibriVox, Public Domain, via Wikimedia. 
- At the end of this page is a quote that the user will recognise from the audiobook provided above.
