            <h2>The Works of Horror</h2>
            <p>
                Lovecraft's major inspiration and invention was cosmic horror: life is incomprehensible to human minds
                and the universe is fundamentally alien. Those who genuinely reason, like his protagonists, gamble with
                sanity. Lovecraft has developed a cult following for his Cthulhu Mythos, a series of loosely
                interconnected fictions featuring a pantheon of human-nullifying entities, as well as the Necronomicon,
                a fictional grimoire of magical rites and forbidden lore.
            </p>
            <p>
                His works were deeply pessimistic and cynical, challenging the values of the Enlightenment, Romanticism
                and Christianity. Lovecraft's protagonists usually achieve the mirror-opposite of traditional gnosis and
                mysticism by momentarily glimpsing the horror of ultimate reality.

                    "H.P. Lovecraft built the stage on which most of the last century's horror fiction was performed. As
                    doomed as any of his protagonists, he put a worldview into words that has spread to infect the
                    world.
