            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Howard Phillips Lovecraft</strong> was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1890. A life-long
                antiquarian who had
                an interest in astronomy, his early work was initially published in the amateur press. His tales of
                horror and the macabre did not see print until the early 1920s, and even then the bulk of his work
                appeared in such pulp magazines as <em>Weird Tales</em>, along with a handful of hardcover anthologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                A voluminous letter-writer, the only book of his fiction published during his lifetime was the privately
                printed <em>Shadow Over Innsmouth(1936).</em> Following his untimely death in 1937, Lovecraft's work was
                initially kept in print by Arkham House publishers and today his fiction - notably the influential
                Cthulhu Mythos - is known all over the world and forms the basis for countless books, movies, comics,
                collectibles and role-playing games.
            </p>
            <p>
                His stories mainly explores the themes of cosmic horror, existential dread, otherworldly beings and
                madness.

                    "H.P. Lovecraft built the stage on which most of the last century's horror fiction was performed. As
                    doomed as any of his protagonists, he put a worldview into words that has spread to infect the
                    world.
